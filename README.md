# ğŸ¦† Aflac Sentiment Analysis Project

This project analyzes public sentiment toward Aflac using data scraped from Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot. The goal was to uncover patterns in how people feel about the brand, and provide data-driven insights that could inform Aflacâ€™s customer engagement and brand strategy.

## ğŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** â€“ Web scraping, sentiment analysis, text processing
- **TextBlob** â€“ Sentiment polarity and subjectivity scoring
- **NLTK** â€“ Tokenization, stopword filtering, and n-gram generation
- **Pandas** â€“ Data wrangling and analysis
- **Tableau** â€“ Data visualization and dashboard creation

## ğŸ§  What I Did

I led nearly all aspects of this project:
- Scraped and cleaned data from Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot
- Performed sentiment analysis without using VADER (as required)
- Built a TF-IDF model to identify high-impact words and phrases
- Created visual dashboards in Tableau to show sentiment over time, by platform, and by star rating
- Synthesized findings to make recommendations for improving brand perception

## ğŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- **Reddit**: In-depth posts often reflected user frustration with claim processes
- **Twitter**: More neutral or scattered sentiment, often influenced by advertising or real-time reactions
- **Trustpilot**: Most polarized sentimentâ€”very positive or very negativeâ€”with strong language tied to specific claim experiences

Overall, sentiment across all platforms leaned **slightly positive**, but trends showed room for improving customer perceptionâ€”especially around claims and communication.

## ğŸ“Š Tableau Dashboard

Visualizations include:
- Average sentiment over time by platform
- Keyword clouds from TF-IDF scoring
- Star ratings vs. polarity charts

## ğŸš€ Future Improvements

- Use a larger dataset and apply advanced sentiment models (e.g., transformer-based)
- Add named entity recognition to analyze sentiment toward specific Aflac services
- Integrate engagement metrics like retweets, likes, and comments
